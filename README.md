#Project Name:  The fight against COVID19: Between the effective plans and prediction
Start Date: March 16
End Date: May 3
Project Summary

In March 11th 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, after confirmed more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries, and 4,291 people have lost their lives, since that time we seen negative impact in economy and the life style, some action been taken from different governments between social isolation, control flight trips, and work remotely.

I found study the available data and the government’s actions in (China, Italy and USA) it might help us to understand and predict the virus behavior, and support the government in coming plans.

Project Summary	Done	Write up the project findes 	
Presentation	Done	Present the results	


Issues
ISSUE NAME	DESCRIPTION and solutions
China Tests for COVID-19	There is no enogh data for china test cases and no transparency 
Enough data for prediction	There is not enough data for prediction which caused to change the prediction period of time from 30 days to 5 days ahead however there is flexibility to change it by change one parameter.

Lesson learned
Experiences distilled from a project that should be actively taken into account in future projects. 
ISSUE NAME	DESCRIPTION
Object Orianted	I never used Object Orianted with python before but it will be much better if it been used in the future.
Analysis	In data analysis I could get the relation between the column (parameters) for better understanding the data collected
